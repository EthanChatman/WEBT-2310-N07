<h1 class="heading_style">About Eikons</h1>
<p>In "Final Fantasy XVI," Eikons are colossal, elemental entities that play a pivotal role in the game's lore and combat system. Each Eikon embodies a distinct element and brings unique powers to the table. For instance, Phoenix represents fire and rebirth, granting abilities centered around intense flames and healing. Shiva, the Eikon of Ice, offers control over frost and ice-based attacks, while Ifrit, another fire Eikon, is associated with raw, destructive power. Other Eikons include Titan, who embodies earth and offers formidable defensive capabilities, and Garuda, who wields wind to manipulate the battlefield. These Eikons are deeply intertwined with the characters and narrative, influencing the protagonist's journey and the world's balance.</p>
