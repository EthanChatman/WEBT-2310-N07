<h1 class="heading_style">Wolves: Abilities & Adaptations</h1>
<p>Wolves possess a combination of physical, sensory, and social abilities that let them hunt, travel, and survive across diverse environments. The sections below summarize the key traits that make wolves effective predators and resilient members of their ecosystems.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Physical Strength & Endurance</h2>
<p>Wolves combine muscular power with high endurance. They can sprint in short bursts (up to ~60 km/h) and sustain long-distance travel when tracking prey or patrolling territory. Their limb and chest structure support stamina during extended chases.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Bite Force & Feeding</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Canis_lupus_head.jpg" alt="Wolf head showing teeth" width="600">
<p>Wolves have strong jaws and teeth adapted for gripping, tearing, and crushing bone. Their bite force and cooperative feeding allow packs to bring down and fully utilize large ungulates, and to access marrow and other nutritious resources.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Sensory Abilities</h2>
<p><strong>Smell:</strong> Wolves have exceptional olfactory sensitivity used to locate prey, detect carrion, and read scent marks from long distances.<br>
<strong>Hearing:</strong> Acute hearing picks up faint sounds of prey and other wolves, enhancing coordination and hunting success.<br>
<strong>Vision:</strong> Wolves see well in low light, aiding dawn, dusk, and nocturnal activity.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Locomotion & Environmental Skills</h2>
<p>Adapted to varied terrain, wolves move efficiently across forests, tundra, mountains, and snow. Padded feet provide traction and silent movement; a layered coat insulates against cold. Many wolves are strong swimmers, capable of crossing rivers during dispersal or hunts.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Cooperative Hunting & Strategy</h2>
<p>Pack hunting is a core ability: wolves use communication, role differentiation, and coordinated maneuvers (flanking, testing, and endurance pursuits) to isolate and subdue prey larger than themselves. Cooperation increases success and reduces individual risk.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Communication & Social Intelligence</h2>
<p>Wolves communicate with howls, barks, growls, facial expressions, and scent marking to coordinate hunts, maintain pack structure, and defend territory. Social learning—pups learning from adults—supports skill transmission and behavioral flexibility.</p>
<hr>

<h2 class="heading_style_2">Adaptability & Problem Solving</h2>
<p>Wolves adjust diet and behavior to local conditions, shifting between hunting, scavenging, and seasonally available foods. They show problem-solving ability in hunting tactics, territory use, and interactions with humans (e.g., learning to avoid roads or deterrents).</p>

    <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Top sprint speed: ~60 km/h (short bursts).</li>
        <li>Daily travel: can cover tens of kilometers while patrolling or dispersing.</li>
        <li>Sensory strength: smell and hearing effective at long range.</li>
        <li>Pack hunting raises success against large prey and supports pup survival.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Abilities Matter</h3>
    <p>These traits shape predator-prey dynamics, influence ecosystem structure, and affect human-wildlife interactions. Understanding wolf abilities helps design better conservation and coexistence strategies.</p>
