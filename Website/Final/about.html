        <h1 class="heading_style">Meet the Wolves</h1>
        <p>Wolves (genus Canis) are highly social, intelligent predators that play a key role in many ecosystems. They live and hunt in family-based packs, communicate using vocalizations and body language, and help regulate prey populations, which in turn influences plant communities and overall biodiversity.</p>
        <p>There are several species and subspecies of wolves, including the well-known gray wolf (Canis lupus) and the smaller red wolf (Canis rufus). Conservation status varies by region; while some populations have recovered thanks to reintroduction and protection efforts, others remain threatened by habitat loss, conflict with humans, and fragmentation.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style_2">Key Species</h2>
        <h3>Gray Wolf (Canis lupus)</h3>
        <img src="https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/145141944/medium.jpg" alt="Gray Wolf">
        <ul>
        <li>Description: The gray wolf is the largest wild member of the dog family, with complex pack dynamics. Packs coordinate hunts of large ungulates and display strong social bonds centered on cooperative breeding and pup-rearing.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Red Wolf (Canis rufus)</h3>
        <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdefenders.org%2Fwildlife%2Fred-wolf&psig=AOvVaw0GbSyyorRYhO50n_VZ2gBu&ust=1761346439588000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBYQjRxqFwoTCNDlvfq0u5ADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" alt="Red Wolf">
        <ul>
        <li>Description: Smaller and more solitary than some gray wolf populations, the red wolf is critically endangered in the wild. Conservation programs focus on habitat protection and managed populations to prevent extinction.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Arctic Wolf (Canis lupus arctos)</h3>
        <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coolantarctica.com%2FAntarctica%2520fact%2520file%2Fwildlife%2FArctic_animals%2Farctic_wolf.php&psig=AOvVaw3Z7AB22LJAgUWnRnCJSo8_&ust=1761346494306000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBYQjRxqFwoTCKiH6Ji1u5ADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAL" alt="Arctic Wolf">
        <ul>
        <li>Description: Adapted to extreme cold, the Arctic wolf has a thick white coat and hunts in open tundra regions. Its isolation from other wolf populations has led to unique behavioral and genetic traits.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Behavior & Ecology</h3>
        <p>Wolves are territorial, can travel long distances, and use scent marking and howling to communicate and coordinate. Pack size and hunting strategies vary with prey availability and habitat. Human-wildlife conflict and ecological change remain major challenges for wolf conservation.</p>
