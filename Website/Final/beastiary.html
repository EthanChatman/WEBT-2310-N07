        <h1>Wolves â€” A Beastiary</h1>
        <p>Wolves are apex predators and keystone species found across a range of habitats from tundra to forests. This beastiary highlights several notable wolf species and subspecies, their identifying traits, habitats, behaviors, and conservation status.</p>

                <h3>Gray Wolf (Canis lupus)</h3>
                <p><strong>Size & Appearance:</strong> Largest wild member of the dog family; coat color ranges from white to black with many grays and browns.</p>
                <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests, mountains, tundra, and grasslands across North America, Eurasia, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
                <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Lives in family-based packs with complex social hierarchies; coordinates cooperative hunts for large ungulates.</p>
                <p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Many populations have recovered under protection and reintroduction programs, though local declines persist due to habitat loss and conflict with humans.</p>

                <h3>Red Wolf (Canis rufus)</h3>
                <p><strong>Size & Appearance:</strong> Smaller and more reddish than gray wolves; slimmer build.</p>
                <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Historically found in southeastern North America; now largely restricted to managed areas and recovery programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Typically forms small family groups; diet includes deer, small mammals and carrion.</p>
                <p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Critically endangered; active recovery and captive-breeding programs aim to restore wild populations.</p>

                <h3>Arctic Wolf (Canis lupus arctos)</h3>
                <p><strong>Size & Appearance:</strong> Pale white coat, often stockier; adapted for extreme cold.</p>
                <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> High Arctic islands and tundra regions with long, harsh winters.</p>
                <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Packs are often smaller and more isolated; hunts seals, muskoxen calves, and other tundra prey when available.</p>
                <p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Less directly affected by humans in remote range, but vulnerable to climate change and shifting prey distributions.</p>

        <h2>Traits & Ecology</h2>
        <p>Wolves are highly social, vocal, and territorial. They communicate with howls, body language, and scent marking. Pack coordination allows wolves to take down prey larger than any single individual could manage, which helps shape prey populations and landscape vegetation patterns.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Human Interactions & Conservation</h2>
        <p>Historically persecuted in many regions, wolves are now the focus of conservation, reintroduction, and conflict-mitigation efforts. Successful coexistence strategies include livestock guardian animals, improved husbandry, compensation programs, and public education about wolf ecology.</p>
