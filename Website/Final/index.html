        <h1 class="heading_style">Wolves: Index of Lives</h1>
        <p>Wolves (genus Canis) are adaptable, social carnivores that influence ecosystems across much of the Northern Hemisphere. This index summarizes their life stages, social roles, hunting strategies, movement patterns, and conservation status.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style_2">Life Stages</h2>
        <p><strong>Pup (0–6 months):</strong> Born in dens and entirely dependent on adults for warmth and food. Play and social learning are critical at this stage.<br>
        <strong>Juvenile (6–18 months):</strong> Rapid development of hunting skills and social behaviors; some disperse to find new territory.<br>
        <strong>Adult (18+ months):</strong> Full participants in pack activities—hunting, territory defense, and breeding.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style_2">Social Structure</h2>
        <p>Packs are family units often led by a dominant breeding pair. Cooperation—shared hunting, pup care, and territory maintenance—defines pack success. Communication includes howling, body postures, facial expressions, and scent marking.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style_2">Hunting & Diet</h2>
        <p>Wolves are opportunistic carnivores. Large packs take down ungulates (deer, elk, moose); smaller groups and individuals target smaller mammals, birds, and carrion. Coordinated hunting increases success and shapes prey populations.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style_2">Movement & Territory</h2>
        <p>Territory size depends on prey density and habitat quality, ranging from tens to thousands of square kilometers. Subadult dispersal maintains genetic exchange between populations and enables recolonization of vacant areas.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style_2">Conservation & Coexistence</h2>
        <p>Some populations have recovered after legal protection and reintroduction; others remain threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, and conflict with people. Effective coexistence strategies include non-lethal deterrents, livestock management, compensation programs, and public education.</p>

        <h3>Habitat & Range</h3>
        <p>Wolves inhabit forests, tundra, mountains, and grasslands across North America, Eurasia, and parts of the Middle East. Range and density vary by species and human impact.</p>

        <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Average pack size: 5–11 (varies by region).</li>
            <li>Communication: howls, growls, whines, scent marks, body language.</li>
            <li>Top speed: ~60 km/h in short bursts.</li>
            <li>Typical lifespan in wild: 6–8 years (some live longer).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conservation Snapshot</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Successes: reintroductions and legal protections have restored some populations.</li>
            <li>Challenges: habitat fragmentation, persecution, and road mortality.</li>
            <li>Actions: habitat corridors, monitoring, conflict mitigation, public outreach.</li>
        </ul>
